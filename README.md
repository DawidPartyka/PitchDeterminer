# PitchDeterminer
## **WIP**
Electron App to determine note based on the signal received from mic.  
  
Currently tested determining sounds down to C1 ~ 32.7Hz (Less than 2Hz difference between C#1 and B0).  
At the moment it's accurate enough down to 2Hz differences.  
  
- Added volume measuring  
- Still ~~a lot~~ a little bit of garbage left in methods waiting for removal
- Added possibility to change input audio device (+ automatically changes when current device gets disconnected)
